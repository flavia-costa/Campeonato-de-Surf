<h2>:pencil2: Project Description</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop a registration and scoring system for a surfing championship, using the Python programming language.</p>
<p>The main objective is to register the names and scores of the participants, in order to enable analysis and classification of the competitors.</p>
<p>As a result, the system will display the three participants with the highest scores.</p>

<h2>:hammer: Features and Application</h2> 
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: The program has the ability to register the name and score of multiple participants in a surfing championship. Additionally, it can calculate the best scores obtained by competitors and display the information of the three participants with the highest scores.</P>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: With this functionality, it is possible to follow the evolution of the competitors throughout the rounds, in addition to quickly identifying the athletes with the best performance and the greatest chance of winning.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: This makes the evaluation process more efficient and accurate, contributing to the organization.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: It is important to note that you must have Python 3.x installed on your computer to run the project.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: To use this project, it is necessary to download 'surfChampionship.py' and save.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: After downloading and saving the necessary file run the main file 'surfChampionship.py' and follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired operations.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“¦ Implantation</h2>
<p>Although the program currently only records the name and score of participants, it is possible to add other types of records, making it more versatile and suitable for different types of competitions.</p>
<p>In addition, the program can be applied to any type of championship or competition, allowing organizers to more efficiently manage participant data and track athlete performance throughout stages.</p>
<p>With this flexibility and adaptability, the program becomes a useful tool for those responsible for organizing sports events and contributes to a more organized and professional experience for competitors.</p>
